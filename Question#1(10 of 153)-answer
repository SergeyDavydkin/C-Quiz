For the call  f(i) , since the type of  i  is  int , template argument deduction deduces  T = int .

The explicit specialization  template <> void f(const int &i)  has  T = const int , which is not the same type as  int , so it doesn't match.

Instead,  template <class T> void f(T &i)  with  T = int  is used to create the implicit instantiation  void f<int>(int&) .
